<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="noindent">No one accustomed to mix with the higher classes
of society will be at all inclined to dispute the
advantages arising from a genteel appearance; it
therefore becomes necessary that the means of
acquiring this distinction should be clearly demonstrated.
An attentive perusal of the following
pages will conduce to this desired effect.</p>

<p>“L’art de mettre sa Cravate est à l’homme du
monde ce que l’art de donner à diner est a l’homme
d’état.”</p>

<p>The Cravat should not be considered as a mere
ornament, it is decidedly one of the greatest preservatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of health—it is a criterion by which
the rank of the wearer may be at once distinguished,
and is of itself “a letter of introduction.”</p>

<p>The most fastidious may in this book find a
model for imitation, as not only the form, but
the colour appropriate to each particular style, is
described in the clearest and most comprehensive
manner.</p>

<p>It can be incontrovertibly asserted that this
work, far from being an ephemeral production,
will be found to contain a mass of useful information,
and may be termed an “Encyclopædia
of knowledge.”</p>

<p>The question whether Cravats were worn by
the ancients is satisfactorily decided.</p>

<p>It is fully proved that the Romans used a
chin cloth, corresponding almost entirely with
the modern Cravat; and that the collar of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
ancient Persians, Egyptians, and Greeks was the
origin of the Stock of the present day.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#SILK">chapter</a> on black and coloured silk Cravats,
it is shewn that the former never obtained
greater celebrity than in the last ten years of the
eighteenth century, and the first ten of the nineteenth;
that is to say, during a term of years replete
with events of the greatest political interest.</p>

<p>The work is divided into easy lessons—the <a href="#LESSON_I">first</a>
gives a solution of the celebrated problem known
as the <i lang="fr">Nœud Gordien</i>, and is the key to all the
others. The <a href="#LESSON_XV">fifteenth</a> lesson alone contains eighteen
different methods of tying the Cravat: but lest
any of our readers may be terrified at the idea of
having so much to acquire at once, it may be necessary
to observe that as they are derivations
from the fourteen first described, they are necessarily
short and easy of attainment.</p>

<p>The first and last lessons (Nos. <a href="#LESSON_I">1</a> and <a href="#LESSON_XVI">16</a>) are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
undoubtedly the most important, on account of
the precepts, opinions, and incontrovertible truths
which they contain. In the concluding chapter
the correct construction of the Cravat is proved
to be of paramount advantage to the wearer; and
the consequences arising from an ignorance of
this important subject are pointed out in a manner
which cannot fail to convince every enlightened
mind.</p>

<p>To render the work complete in every respect,
plates, drawn from nature, are inserted; these
will clearly explain any difficulty a beginner may
experience in comprehending our directions, and
will enable him to judge whether he has produced
the proper effect on his own Cravat.</p>

<p>In an age like the present, when the man of
quality is so closely imitated by the pretender—when
the amalgamation of all ranks seems to be
the inevitable consequence of the “<em>March of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Intellect</em>” now making such rapid strides amongst
us, we think a more signal service cannot be rendered
to the higher ranks of society, than by the
production of such a work as this; and, in the
hope of being really useful, we offer to a discerning
public the “Art of Tying on the Cravat.”</p>

<h2 id="HISTORY">THE<br />
HISTORY OF THE CRAVAT;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
<span class="smaller">FROM ITS ORIGIN TO THE PRESENT DAY;</span><br />
WITH REMARKS<br />
<span class="smaller">ON ITS INFLUENCE ON SOCIETY IN GENERAL.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">No decided opinion can be given of the age in
which Cravats were first introduced. The ancients
were happily unacquainted with the ridiculous and
dangerous fashion of confining the throat in linen,
either tied in front or fastened behind with a clasp;
this part of the frame was allowed to remain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
entire liberty; they, however, defended it from
the cold by means of a woollen or silken cloth,
called in Rome <i lang="la">focalium</i>, a term which is evidently
derived from fauces (the throat).</p>

<p>A distinguished Jesuit (the Rev. Father Adam)
in his work on Roman antiquities, proves by
the most undoubted authority that the Romans
made use of chin cloths, for the protection of the
neck and throat; these were termed focalia, and
the public orators, who from professional considerations
were fearful of taking cold, contributed
in no small degree to render this fashion
general. Some (says the Rev. Father) used a
handkerchief (sudarium) for this purpose. This
is probably the origin of the Cravat, which is in
many countries called “Neckhandkerchief.”</p>

<p>Augustus, who was infirm and sickly, constantly
used the focalium when at his own house, or
with his friends, but he was never seen in it in
public; and Lampridius observes that Alexander
Severus made use of it only when returning from
the baths to his palace. In Rome the custom of
leaving the neck bare was so general, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
considered beneath the dignity of the man and
citizen to protect it in any other way than by the
hand, or occasionally wrapping the toga round it.</p>

<p>The throats of our forefathers were for ages as
uncovered as their faces; in this respect the descendants
of the Sarmatæ have not degenerated,
as the Poles during the most severe winter have
their throats constantly exposed. The same fashion
(which is, however, less surprising) has descended
to the Eastern Nations, among whom a
white and well turned neck is metaphorically compared
to the beauty of a tower of ivory. The
Calmucks, Baskirs, and other Tartars of the Don,
or the borders of the Caspian Sea, also adhere to
this fashion; very few of them, however, merit
the Eastern compliment, as their throats are generally
ugly and ill-formed. This custom gradually
declined in France and several parts of Europe,
and luxury, rather than necessity, introduced the
fashion of covering the throat loosely with a fine
starched linen cloth; this was worn above the
shirt, without a collar; the ends were brought
down on the breast, and there fastened by laces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of thread—from this the idea of bands was derived—before
the introduction of the heavy and
unhealthy bonds, which at a later period confined
the throat, was even dreamt of.</p>

<p>The ruff, stiffened and curled in single or double
rows (an inconvenient but harmless ornament),
became the favourite in its turn, and continued in
fashion while the hair was worn short; but this
also fell into disrepute when Louis XIII. allowed
his to grow. Then raised collars, plaited neck-cloths,
and bands (both plain and of lace), enveloped
the throats of our ancestors, from the neck
to the chin, and covered the tops of the arms and
the shoulders. This fashion continued until Louis
XIV. adopted the enormous flaxen or black peruke,
which almost concealed the front of the
neck. It then gave way to bright coloured ribands
arranged in bows, which were also introduced by
this gay and gallant monarch, and imitated by
every one according to his rank or caprice.</p>

<p>Up to that time, as frivolity alone had reigned,
the fashion was not injurious; but the throat,
which had hitherto been comparatively free, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
lost that liberty which it has never since regained.
In 1660 a regiment of Croats arrived in France;—a
part of their singular costume excited the greatest
admiration, and was immediately and generally
imitated; this was a <i lang="fr">tour de cou</i>, made (for the
private soldiers) of common lace, and of muslin
or silk for the officers; the ends were arranged
<i lang="fr">en rosette</i>, or ornamented with a button or tuft,
which hung gracefully on the breast. This new
arrangement, which confined the throat but very
slightly, was at first termed a Croat, since corrupted
to Cravat. The Cravats of the officers
and people of rank were extremely fine, and the
ends were embroidered or trimmed with broad
lace; those for the lower classes were subsequently
made of cloth or cotton, or at the best of black
taffeta, plaited; which was tied round the neck
by two small strings. These strings were at a
later period replaced by clasps, or a buckle, and
the Cravat then took the name of <em>Stock</em>.</p>

<p>The Cravat at length became universal, and was
increased to an almost incredible size. Some enveloped
the neck in entire pieces of muslin; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wore a stitched stiffener, on which several handkerchiefs
were folded. By this <i lang="fr">échafaudage</i> the
neck was placed on a level with the head, which
in size it surpassed, and with which it was confounded.
The shirt collar rose to the side of the
ears, and the top of the Cravat covered the mouth
and lower part of the nose, so that the face (with
the exception of the nose) was concealed by the
Cravat and a forest of whiskers; these rose on
each side to the hair, which was combed down
over the eyes. In this costume the <i lang="fr">élégans</i> bore
a greater resemblance to beasts than men, and
the fashion gave rise to many laughable caricatures.
They were compelled to look straight before
them, as the head could only be turned by
general consent of all the members, and the <i lang="fr">tout
ensemble</i> was that of an unfinished statue.</p>

<p>Instances have, however, occurred in which
these immense Cravats have saved the lives of the
wearers in battle. One fact, as related by Dr.
Pizis, may be worthy of record. “I was laughing”
(says he) “at General Lepale, on account
of his enormous Cravat. At the moment of entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
into action his regiment charged, and after
dispersing the enemy’s cavalry returned to the
<i lang="fr">bivouac</i>. I was informed that the General had
been struck by a pistol shot in the throat. I immediately
hastened to his assistance, and was
shewn a bullet, which was stopped in its career
by the very Cravat I had just been ridiculing.—Two
officers and several privates had received sabre
cuts on the Cravat, and escaped without injury;
so that I was obliged to confess that these
immense bandages were not always useless.”</p>

<p>Singers more than any class of persons, should
be careful to avoid exposing the throat to the cold,
a moderate heat contributes to supple the organs,
and renders the voice clearer and more harmonious;
though, on the contrary, it is greatly
deteriorated if the throat is constrained by a tightened
Cravat. No part of the body is more susceptible
of cold than the neck; and this susceptibility
is the effect of too much covering in general;
but in leaving a ball room, or any heated
place, the greatest care should be taken to defend
the chest and neck from cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives of the South are but too well acquainted
with the danger of such sudden transitions,
and the Spaniards particularly, who always
wear a large handkerchief hanging carelessly from
the neck, invariably wrap themselves in it, when
being warm they are suddenly exposed to the cold.</p>

<p>In short, the Cravat has now arrived at the
summit of perfection, and has been materially
assisted in its progress by the use of starch. The
question naturally arises to whom is the world indebted
for this sublime invention? To the English,
Russians, Italians, or French?—On this
point we confess ourselves unable to decide. The
<i lang="fr">blanchisseuses</i> of each of those powers have been
mainly instrumental in communicating this important
discovery to the world at large.</p>

<p>On our parts, more profound investigations
would be unavailing; and it is only by a continued
course of laborious research, that it would
be possible to remove the obscurity which has
enveloped the subject of our labours for so many
ages.</p>

<h2 id="STOCKS">STOCKS:<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Considerations on the origin of Stocks:—their
advantages, inconveniences, colours, forms,
and fashions.</i></span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Although the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and
nearly all the ancient nations, were unacquainted
with the use of Cravats and Stocks, they wore collars,
which may reasonably be considered as the
<i lang="fr">avant-couriers</i> of both.</p>

<p>Collars, made of the richest metals, and lined
with a soft cloth, were worn, like the modern
Stock, to ornament the face and support the chin.
The general use of collars amongst the ancients,
and Stocks in our own times, would almost prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that when man is left to himself, “his nose is
much more inclined to claim acquaintance with
the earth,” (to use the expression of a celebrated
French author), “than his eyes with the Heavens,”
as Buffon asserts.</p>

<p>However that may be, collars have been entirely
superseded by the introduction of Stocks:
these are in fact collars, though composed of different
materials—they form no wrinkle—make
but one turn round the neck, and are fastened
behind by a buckle or clasps.</p>

<p>Stocks were first introduced as military costume
about the commencement of the eighteenth
century. Choiseul, minister of war under Louis
XV. presented them to the troops in lieu of the
Cravat.</p>

<p>These Stocks were made of black horse-hair,
tolerably hard, moderately wide, and were only
injurious when fastened too tightly. In many regiments,
the officers wishing the men to appear
healthy, obliged them to tighten the Stock so as
almost to produce suffocation, instead of allowing
them more nourishing food, or of treating them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with more kindness; or, in short, of giving them
an opportunity of acquiring that health, the appearance
only of which was produced by the
tightened stock.</p>

<p>The Stock has ever since formed a part of
military costume. Invention has been racked
to diversify it as much as possible; and, as
appearance alone was consulted, each change
has rendered it more injurious; it has been
transformed into a collar as hard as iron, by the
insertion of a slip of wood, which acting on the
larynx, and compressing every part of the neck,
caused the eyes almost to start from their spheres,
and gave the wearer a supernatural appearance
often producing vertigos and faintings, or at least
bleeding at the nose. It rarely happened that a
field-day passed over without surgical aid being
required by one or more soldiers, whose illness
was only produced by an over-tightened Stock.
As the same kind of Stock was used for necks of
all sizes, whether long or short, thin or thick,
it rendered the weaver, in many cases, almost
immoveable; he was scarcely able to obey the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
order, “right face—left face,” and was entirely
prohibited from stooping.</p>

<p>Stocks have lately been much improved, and
these objections no longer exist. The best Stocks
for general use are made of whalebone, thinned
at the edges, with a border of white leather,
which entirely prevents that unpleasant scratching
of the chin so often produced by the whalebone
penetrating the upper part.</p>

<h2 id="SILK">THE
BLACK AND COLOURED SILK
CRAVAT.</h2>

<p class="noindent">The world in general is well informed of the
source from which silk is derived; that it proceeds
from an industrious insect of the order
lepidoptera, known as the silk worm; which, in
forming a light soft thread of almost infinite
length, produces a bag, in which it undergoes the
transformation from the chrysalis to the butterfly.
As silk occupies so important a station in the
toilet, it can hardly be less important that we
should here offer a few remarks upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Romans the use of silk was general:
scarcely any other material was worn on the neck.
Augustus always used a silk handkerchief, and
his example was imitated by all the <i lang="fr">petits-maitres</i>
of Rome, among whom the appearance of delicate
health was considered a distinguishing mark of
ton. It was also a constant attendant at the ladies’
toilet (mundus muliebris), and they called the
handkerchief bissyna sudaria. It is probable that
the Roman sidon resembled the large shawls now
worn by the English ladies.</p>

<p>It appears that there was a company of silk-women
in England as early as 1455; but these
were probably employed in needle-work, as Italy
supplied the broad material. Henry II, is said
to have been the first who wore silk knit stockings;
though the invention came from Spain,
whence silk stockings were afterwards brought
to Henry VIII. and Edward VI.</p>

<p>The advantages of this manufacture caused its
introduction to be strongly recommended by James
I. and in 1608 mulberry-trees were planted for the
purpose of cultivating the worm—this, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
failed. Towards the latter end of this king’s
reign (about 1620) the manufacture of broad silk
was introduced; and in 1629 was so much increased
that the silk throwsters were incorporated
as a public body. In 1661 above 40,000 persons
were employed.</p>

<p>The Revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685,
greatly promoted the English manufactures, as
did also the invention of the throwing machine at
Derby in 1719. Great improvements have since
taken place, and our manufacturers now yield the
palm to none.</p>

<p>The black silk Cravat is now generally worn,
and coloured silk handkerchiefs have been partially
patronized. Napoleon generally wore a black
silk Cravat, as was remarked at Wagram, Lodi,

<p class="noindent">When the Cravats are brought from the laundress
they should undergo a careful examination, previous
to classing them, to ascertain whether they
are properly washed, ironed, and folded; and for
the purpose of deciding on the exact style in
which each may be worn with the best effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The <em>set</em> of the Cravat and the neatness of the tie
entirely depends on its being correctly <em>got</em> up.</p>

<p class="tb">If these requisites are not carefully attended to,
the Cravat immediately fades and becomes yellow,
whilst on the contrary, if properly prepared,
it presents an elegant and <i lang="fr">recherché</i> appearance.</p>

<p class="tb">Starch gives a combination of substance, elasticity,
and suppleness to the handkerchief, and by
filling up the smallest holes effectually excludes
the cold air in winter. In summer it also possesses
the incalculable advantage of preventing
the Cravat from adhering too closely to the neck,
and thereby producing an uncomfortable heat.</p>

<p class="tb">Whatever style may have been adopted in putting
on the Cravat, when the knot is once formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
(whether good or bad) it should not be changed
under any pretence whatever.</p>

<p class="tb">In the duties of the toilet, we may compare the
tie of the Cravat to the <i lang="fr">liaisons de sauces blanches</i>
of the kitchen; the least error is fatal to the whole
composition of either, and as a new sauce must
be prepared, with entirely fresh ingredients, so
must a new tie be produced by a fresh Cravat.</p>

<p class="tb">When the Cravat is satisfactorily arranged, the
finger must be passed lightly along the top, to
smooth and thin it, and cause it to coincide with
the shirt collar.</p>

<p class="tb">A small iron, with a handle, made expressly for
the purpose, and moderately warm, is the best
instrument for producing a thin and equal edge
to the Cravat; it will also serve to smooth the tie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
but great care must be taken that it is clean and
glossy, as without this precaution spots will be
inevitable.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-a">See plate A, fig. 5.</a></p>

<p class="tb">When a Cravat has not been previously folded
by the laundress, and you have prepared it yourself,
of the exact height required by the style
you intend to adopt, particular attention should be
paid to the folding the ends, one of which must
be folded <em>down</em> and the other <em>up</em>, as it may be,
the right or left end.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-a">Plate A, fig 2.</a></p>

<p class="tb">The great advantages of this method will be
immediately perceptible, in the prevention of that
disagreeable prominence which is generally produced
at the back of the neck by the junction of
the ends; which being brought to the front without
being soiled, or tumbled in the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
degree, are more easily formed into an elegant
tie.</p>

<p class="tb">The same care and attention are necessary to
the back as to the front of the Cravat.</p>

<p class="tb">Although coloured Cravats are made of more
costly materials than those which are entirely
plain, it is most clearly laid down, as a rule in
the laws of taste, that they can be admitted only
as undress costume.</p>

<p>The white Cravat, with spots or squares, is
received as half-dress; but the plain white alone
is allowed at balls or <i lang="fr">soirées</i>.</p>

<p>The black Stock, or Cravat, is only suited to
military men, not on service, who are dressed in
plain clothes. As to coloured Cravats, they are
entirely prohibited in evening parties.</p>

<p class="noindent">It would be very difficult to offer to our readers
an exact and perfectly intelligible explanation of
this most elegant style—of the sovereign of Cravat
ties, the <i lang="fr">Nœud Gordien</i>, the origin of which
is lost in the obscurity of antiquity.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the laborious researches we
have bestowed on this interesting subject, we
have hitherto been unable to discover the name
of the genius to whom the honor of this invention
is due. We only know (and it is, we believe, generally
known) that Alexander the great, irritated
at being unable to comprehend the theory of its
composition, and determined not to be foiled,
adopted the shorter and easier method of solving
the question—that of cutting it with his sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In our own times we occasionally meet with
young aspirants, who, in the fullest acceptation
of the term, adopt the Gordian tie; with this
difference, however, that when they wish to untie
it, as a sword like that of the Macedonian
monarch is too cumbersome for their delicate
hands, they make use of a pair of scissors, with
which they are more familiar—but to our subject.</p>

<p>We confess, with regret, that we can only speak
imperfectly of this interesting tie; but as theory
is nothing when compared to practice, we will
endeavour to address ourselves to the eyes, rather
than to the judgment of our readers, in the
conviction that, though we may be unable to accomplish
our object entirely, we shall, at least,
approach it as nearly as possible. Attention!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h3>PROBLEM.</h3>

<p>In the first place, the Cravat for this tie must
be of ample size, and properly starched, ironed,
and folded (<i>as shewn <a href="#plate-b">plate B. fig. 6</a></i>); whether
it be plain or coloured is of little consequence;
but a rather stout one should be preferred, as it
will offer more facilities to the daring fingers of
the beginner who attempts to accomplish this
<i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>.</p>

<p>It will then be necessary to meditate deeply
and seriously on the five following directions.</p>

<p>I. When you have decided on the Cravat, it
must be placed on the neck, and the ends left
hanging (<i>as shewn <a href="#plate-b">plate B, fig. 7</a>, first time</i>).</p>

<p>II. You must take the point K, pass it on the
inside of the point Z, and raise it (<i><a href="#plate-b">same plate,
fig. 8</a>, second time</i>).</p>

<p>III. You lower the point K on the tie, now half
formed O (<i><a href="#plate-b">same plate, fig. 9</a>, third time</i>).</p>

<p>IV. Then, without leaving the point K, you
bend it inside and draw it between the point Z,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which you repass to the left, Y; in the tie now
formed, Y, O, you thus accomplish the formation
of the destined knot.</p>

<p>V. and last. After having tightened the knot,
and flattened it with the thumb and fore-finger,
or more properly with the iron, mentioned in the
preceding lesson (<i>see <a href="#plate-a">plate A, fig. 5</a></i>); you lower
the points, K, Z, cross them, and place a pin at
the point of junction H, and at once solve the
problem of the <i lang="fr">Nœud Gordien</i>.</p>

<p>He who is perfectly conversant with the theory
and practice of this tie, may truly boast that he
possesses the key to all the others, which are, in
fact, derived from this alone. A Cravat which
has been once worn in this way, can only be used
afterwards <i lang="fr">en negligé</i>, as it will be so much tumbled
by this intricate arrangement.</p>

<p>The slightest error in the first fold of this tie
will render all succeeding efforts, with the same
handkerchief, entirely useless—we have said it.</p>

<p>We would, therefore, seriously advise any one
who really desires to be initiated in the mysteries
of this delightful science, to make his first essay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
on a moderate sized block. We can confidently
assure him, that with moderate perseverance, he
will soon be enabled to pursue his studies with
pleasure and advantage—on himself.</p>

<p>(A careful examination of the figures referred
to in this lesson is strongly recommended).</p>

<span class="smaller">Cravate à l’Orientale.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">Plate C, fig. 12.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The shape of the <i lang="fr">Cravate à l’Orientale</i>, is that
of a turban, and the ends form a crescent; in this
instance we wear that under the chin, which the
Mahometans wear above the forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>One of our antiquarian friends, who has devoted
his time to long and laborious researches on
the origin of Cravats, asserts, that the real <i lang="fr">Cravate
à l’Orientale</i> consists of a very small silken
cord; and that in the highest circles of Turkey, it
is sometimes the custom to draw it tighter than
the human frame can well bear; he very properly
adds that this fashion produces the most serious
results to the health of any one who is suddenly
compelled to adopt it.</p>

<p>The Cravat, for this style, must be small, that
it may present two small ends only; these must
be strongly starched at the tips, that they may
retain the form of the crescent, as not the slightest
wrinkle can be suffered. A whalebone stiffener
must, therefore, be used, as the least deviation
from this rule will entirely deprive it of its
denomination <i lang="fr">Orientale</i>.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Cravate à l’Orientale</i> must be of the
purest white muslin, or white cachemire.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate referred to.</a></p>

<span class="smaller">Cravate à l’Américaine.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 13.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The <i lang="fr">Cravate à l’Américaine</i> is extremely pretty
and easily formed, provided the handkerchief is
well starched.</p>

<p>When it is correctly formed, it presents the
appearance of a column, destined to support a
Corinthian capital. This style has many admirers
here, and also among our friends, the fashionables
of the New World, who pride themselves on its
name, which they call “Independence;” this title
may, to a certain point, be disputed, as the neck
is fixed in a kind of vice, which entirely prohibits
any very free movements.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Cravate à l’Américaine</i> requires a whalebone
stiffener, and is commenced in the same way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as the <i lang="fr">Nœud Gordien</i>; the ends are brought in
front, as shown in <a href="#plate-c">fig. 8, plate C</a>, are lowered as
in <a href="#plate-c">fig. 9 (same plate)</a>, and fastened to the shirt
bosom, like the <i lang="fr">Cravate en Cascade</i>.</p>

<p>The prevailing colour is sea green, or striped
blue, red and white.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate referred to.</a></p>

<h2 id="LESSON_V">LESSON V.<br />
<span class="smaller">Cravate Collier de Cheval.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">Plate C, fig. 14.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">This style greatly resembles the <i lang="fr">Orientale</i>, from
which it is evidently derived. It has been greatly
admired by the fair sex, who have praised it to
their husbands, their lovers, and even to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
friends and relations; and have thus promoted
its adoption by every means in their power.</p>

<p>The ends are fastened at the back of the neck,
or are concealed in the folds; a whalebone stiffener
is requisite, but starch is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Cravats with horizontal stripes, or large spots,
are preferred. The most becoming colour is that
called Russia leather. Black is sometimes worn,
but the shirt bosom must then be plaited.</p>

<p>Human life is often compared to a painful journey;
and it is probably on the same philosophical
principle that the <i lang="fr">Cravate Collier de Cheval</i> was
considered a proper costume for man, who often
drags on his weary way, loaded with evils more
insupportable than the heaviest burthens.</p>

<p>This style is, however, (in our opinion) rather
vulgar, and we have introduced it here, more that
it may be avoided as an instance of false taste,
than as a model to copy.</p>

<p>It is folded as shewn in <a href="#plate-a">plate A, fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate referred to.</a></p>

<span class="smaller">Cravate Sentimentale.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">Plate C, fig. 15.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The name alone of this Cravat is sufficient to explain
that it is not alike suitable to all faces.</p>

<p>You, then, whom nature has not gifted with
skins of silk—eyes of fire—with complexions
rivalling the rose and lily;—you, to whom she
has denied pearly teeth and coral lips (a gift which
in our opinion would be rather inconvenient)—you,
in fact, whose faces do not possess that
sympathetic charm, which in a moment, at a
glance, spreads confusion o’er the senses, and disorder
and trouble in the hearts of all who behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you—be careful how you expose to public gaze
a head like that of a peruquier. We repeat—avoid
it; and be assured that if your physiognomy
does not inspire sensations of love and passion,
and you should adopt the <i lang="fr">Cravate Sentimentale</i>,
you will be a fair butt for the shafts of ridicule,
which (with no unsparing hand) will be showered
upon you on all sides.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, for the juvenile only that it is
at all adapted, and there should even be something
boyish in the general appearance of the
wearer. It may, then, be worn from the age of
seventeen to twenty-seven; but after that age it
cannot, with propriety, be patronized by even the
most agreeable.</p>

<p>It must be allowed that this style is completely
opposed to the <i lang="fr">Orientale</i> and <i lang="fr">Collier de Cheval</i>.
It must be strongly starched, and fastened with
a single <i lang="fr">rosette</i> at the top, as near as possible to
the chin.</p>

<p>It is more fashionable in the country than in
town. Cambric is generally preferred.</p>

<span class="smaller">Cravate à la Byron.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">Plate C, fig. 16.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">As Lord Byron differed so widely from the world
in general, we can hardly expect to find in the
Cravat worn by this prince of poets, any of that
<i lang="fr">élégance recherchée</i> which generally characterize
an Englishman of rank. It is universally allowed
that the least constraint of the body has a corresponding
effect on the mind, and it must, therefore,
be admitted, that to a certain extent, a tight Cravat
will cramp the imagination, and, as it were, suffocate
the thoughts.</p>

<p>That Lord Byron feared this effect, is proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
from his submitting to the inconveniences of a
Cravat, only when accommodating himself to the
<i lang="fr">bienséances</i> of society; and in every portrait
where he is painted in the ardour of composition,
his neck is always free from the trammels of the
neckcloth.</p>

<p>The Cravat which bears the name of this noble
author, differs widely from most others—this
difference consists in the manner in which it is
first placed on the neck. It is commenced at
the back of the neck—the ends are then brought
in front under the chin, and fastened in a large
bow, or <i lang="fr">rosette</i>, at least six inches in length and
four in circumference.</p>

<p>This fashion is extremely comfortable in summer,
and during long journeys, as it forms but
one turn round the neck, which is thus left comparatively
free.</p>

<p>Either black or white may be worn, but it
should not be starched, and is folded as shewn in
<a href="#plate-a">plate A, fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 17.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The <i lang="fr">Cravate en Cascade</i> is formed by making a
single knot, like that in the second lesson, <a href="#plate-b">plate
B, fig. 8</a>, and leaving one end longer than the
other; the longer, after being brought on the inside
(as in the plate and figure referred to) must
be lowered so as to cover the whole of the knot—carefully
spread out as wide as possible, and then
fastened to the bosom of the shirt. The <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>
will then present the appearance of the
<i lang="fr">Cascade</i>, or <i lang="fr">Jet d’Eau</i> in the bason of the Palais
Royal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Like the <i lang="fr">Cravate à la Byron</i>, which it greatly
resembles, the <i>Bergami</i> is first placed at the
back of the neck—the ends are brought forward
and crossed on the breast, without being tied, and
then fastened to the braces; some pass them under
the arms, and tie them on the back; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
handkerchief must then be very large, and folded

<p class="noindent">The <i lang="fr">Cravate de Bal</i> should not be tied, but
fastened with pins to the braces, or to the shirt,
in the same way as the <i>Bergami</i>. Some pass the
ends under the arms, and tie them on the back;
but as this method is inconvenient, from the
handkerchief moving with the body in dancing,
we would recommend the two first.</p>

<p>It should be simply and plainly folded, (as
shewn in <a href="#plate-b">plate B, fig. 6</a>), and must be tolerably
large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Cravate de Bal</i>, when carefully put on is
delightfully elegant; it partakes of the elegant
<i lang="fr">sévérité</i> of the <i lang="fr">Mathématique</i>, combined with the
<i lang="fr">laissez-aller</i> of the <i>Bergami</i>, whilst it unites the
advantages of both; it is in fact, a derivation from
them.</p>

<p>We must here enter an entire prohibition against
colours of every kind for the <i lang="fr">Cravate de Bal</i>—white
must reign alone.</p>

<p>The Cravat should be but slightly starched.</p>

majestic oak; but the correct and beautiful proportion
of a Grecian column (even in ruins) rivets
our attention and excites our wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Cravate Mathématique</i> is a combination
of symmetry and regularity—the style is grave
and severe, and the slightest wrinkle is strictly
prohibited. The ends should be geometrically
correct, and must bear examination even by the
aid of a compass; they should descend obliquely
from each side, and form two acute angles in
crossing—all the folds in a horizontal direction,
forming the two acute and opposite angles of a
triangle, which the <i lang="fr">Mathématique</i> must always
strictly represent.</p>

<span class="smaller">Cravate à l’Irlandaise.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">Plate C, fig. 21.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">This Cravat very closely resembles the <i lang="fr">Mathématique</i>,
and differs only in the arrangement of
the ends, which in the <i lang="fr">Irlandaise</i> are joined in
front and twine round each other—each end is
then brought back to the side it comes from, and
is fastened at the back of the neck.</p>

<p>This difference, which would be invisible to a
superficial observer, will not escape the critical
eye of an <i lang="fr">élégant</i>, accustomed to peruse this important
work with the care and attention it merits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Irlandaise</i> is not confined to any particular
colour, and the handkerchief need not be starched,
but a whalebone stiffener is necessary.</p>

<span class="smaller">Cravate à la Maratte.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">Plate C, fig. 22.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The Cravat for this style should be of the finest
and whitest India muslin. Like the <i>Byron</i>, it is
commenced at the back of the neck, and linked
like a chain; the ends may either be fastened like
those of the <i lang="fr">Cravat de Bal</i> (to the braces, or on
the back), or to the shirt bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Maratte</i> does not require starch, and
should be simply and plainly folded.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate referred to.</a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LESSON_XIV">LESSON XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">Cravate à la Gastronome.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">Plate C, fig. 23.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The <i lang="fr">véritable Cravate à la Gastronome</i> is a
handkerchief of any kind, without starch, folded
on a stiffener of at most three fingers in depth, and
thrown rather than fastened round the neck: it is
more particularly distinguished by the tie which
confines the ends; this greatly resembles the
<i lang="fr">Nœud Gordien</i> in elasticity, with this difference,
however, that it slackens and yields to the slightest
movement of the neck—to the least vacillation
of the jaws, and even to that slight swelling
of the throat which in men decidedly distinguished
for gastronomic talents, so often produces impeded
respiration. It also possesses the great
advantage of loosening itself in cases of indigestion,
apoplexy, or fainting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Gastronome</i> is seldom worn previous to the
age of forty, but this greatly depends on climate
and constitution.</p>

<span class="smaller">Eighteen different methods of putting
on the Cravat.</span></h2>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">Plate D, figures 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Although this lesson comprehends eighteen different
methods of wearing the Cravat, yet as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
they are nearly all derived from some of those
already explained, it is but little longer than any
one of them. It is placed nearly at the end of the
work as it is absolutely necessary that the thirteen
first should be well studied and digested,
previous to entering upon this; for it would be as
vain for a veteran <i lang="fr">fashionable</i> to attempt the formation
of any of the following, without having
previously made himself acquainted with the preceding,
as for a young mathematician to attempt
an explanation of the third book of Legendre,
without having studied the first and second.</p>

<h3 id="h3-1">Cravate de Chasse.</h3>

<p class="noindent">This Cravat is by some <i lang="fr">élégans</i> called <i lang="fr">à la Diane</i>,
although it is a kind of poetical license to suppose
that this rather unfashionable Goddess wore
one. It is doubly crossed on the neck, as shewn
in the <i lang="fr">Cravate à l’Américaine</i> (<a href="#plate-c">plate C, fig. 13</a>).
It should not be starched, and must be folded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
plainly, as shewn in <a href="#plate-a">plate A, fig. 1</a>—the colour
must be deep green, or <i lang="fr">feuille morte</i>, which is
more <i lang="fr">recherché</i>.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 24.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-2">Cravate à la Diane.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Exactly similar to the last, but the colour must
be white.</p>

<h3 id="h3-3">Cravate à l’Anglaise.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Is formed in the same way as the <i lang="fr">Nœud Gordien</i>,
but is never starched.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-b">See plate B, fig. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-4">Cravate à l’Indépendance.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The same as the <i lang="fr">Américaine</i>, except in colour; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
is composed of red, blue and white, in alternate
stripes; all other shades are strictly prohibited.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 13.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-5">Cravate en Valise.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Is composed like the <i lang="fr">Nœud Gordien</i>, except the
ends, which, instead of being brought down, are
turned inside the knot; the handkerchief must be
rather small, or it will be impossible to conceal
the ends, which with the knot should present the
appearance of a travelling portmanteau.</p>

<p>The favourite colour is that of Russia leather.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 25.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-6">Cravate en Coquille.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The tie of this Cravat should resemble a shell;
it is very pleasing, and easily formed; it consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of a double or triple knot, and the ends are
fastened at the back of the neck. It does not
require starch, and may be worn with or without
a whalebone stiffener.</p>

<p>The colour may be that most pleasing to the
wearer.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 26.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-7">Cravate de Voyage.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Is put on in the same way as the <i>Byron</i>.</p>

<h3 id="h3-8">Cravate à la Colin.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Is commenced like the <i>Byron</i>, <i>Bergami</i>, and
<i lang="fr">Talma</i>; a mere knot is made, the ends left loose,
and shirt collar turned down, as shewn in the
<i lang="fr">Cravate Jesuitique</i>.</p>

<p>This style possesses the great advantage of preventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the wearer from entering any public
place, and of causing him to be shewn (politely)
to the door of any private house.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 27 and 32.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-9">Cravate en Jet d’Eau.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The same as the <i lang="fr">Cravate en Cascade</i>.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 17.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-10">Cravate Casse Cœur.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The same as the <i>Bergami</i>; the favourite colour
is red (<i lang="fr">Sang de Bœuf</i>).</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 18.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h3-11">Cravate à la Paresseuse.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The <i lang="fr">Paresseuse</i> is undoubtedly one of the most
convenient and easy methods of wearing the
Cravat. It has been rather neglected, and we
think unjustly so, as it combines the advantage of
concealing the shirt of the wearer, and displaying
the handkerchief to advantage. It may be put on
in a moment, and this style can be adopted with
complete success in wearing a handkerchief a
second time. It should be prepared as shewn in
<a href="#plate-a">plate A, fig. 2</a>; placed on the front of the neck,
the ends are passed round and crossed on the
chest, as shewn in <a href="#plate-d">plate D, fig. 28</a>.</p>

<p>Married men and antiquated beaux seem to be
its greatest admirers; it may be starched or not
ad libitum.</p>

<h3 id="h3-12">Cravate Romantique.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The same as the <i>Byron</i>; it is chiefly worn in the
country, and the prevailing colour is <i lang="fr">solitaire</i>.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 16.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h3-13">Cravate à la Fidélité.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The same as the <i lang="fr">Mathématique</i>. The privates of
the ex-national guard of France wore it when in
uniform, and it has since been recommended to
the ex-ministry of our own country. It must be
black, and folded on a whalebone stiffener, and
should be so carefully put on as to prevent all
appearance of the shirt, except the collar, which
must be of the most dazzling white.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 20.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-14">Cravate à la Talma.</h3>

<p class="noindent">This style is worn in mourning only. It is placed
on the neck in the same way as the <i>Byron</i> and
<i>Bergami</i>.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 29.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h3-15">Cravate à l’Italienne.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Is formed in nearly the same manner as the <i lang="fr">Irlandaise</i>,
but instead of turning the ends round
each other, they are passed through a ring, returned
to the side they come from and fastened at
the back of the neck by a small knot.</p>

<p>It requires a whalebone stiffener, and should
be prepared as shewn in <a href="#plate-a">plate A, fig. 1</a>. Starch
is unnecessary. White only is admissible.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 30.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-16">Cravate Diplomatique.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The same as the <i lang="fr">Cravate à la Gastronome</i>.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-c">See plate C, fig. 28.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="h3-17">Cravate à la Russe.</h3>

<p class="noindent">In this style are included all Cravats which are
fastened at the back of the neck, without the
ends being at all brought in front; these should
not be concealed under the Cravat, but down the
back, and care must be taken to prevent their
rising above the waistcoat. Any colour is allowed,
and starch may be used or not ad libitum.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 31.</a></p>

<h3 id="h3-18">Cravate Jesuitique.</h3>

<p class="noindent">This is a Cravat in appearance only.</p>

<p>For this style the waistcoat must be made <i lang="fr">en
cuirasse</i>, and the collar must be high enough to
conceal the neck entirely. The shirt collar is
turned down and forms a kind of band.</p>

<p>Although this style has lately become very general,
we have never been at all prepossessed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
its favour; not merely because it is unpleasant
to the eye, but that we rather pride ourselves in
despising most cordially whatever has the least
resemblance to the name or quality of a Jesuit.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><a href="#plate-d">See plate D, fig. 32.</a></p>

<p class="tb">In closing this lesson, we must observe, that
although we have specified the colour which fashion
seems to have patronized for each particular
style of Cravat, we do not (in any instance) intend
to exclude the chaste simplicity of white,
which may be introduced in any of them.</p>

<h2 id="LESSON_XVI">LESSON XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">AND LAST.<br />
<i>Important and necessary Observations.</i></span></h2>

<p>In all cases of apoplexy, fainting, or illness
in general, it is requisite to loosen or even remove
the Cravat immediately.</p>

<p class="tb">The greatest insult that can be offered to a
man, <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i>, is to seize him by the Cravat;
in this case blood only can wash out the
stain upon the honour of either party.</p>

<p class="tb">The Cravat should invariably be loosened before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the commencement of study, or of any important
business.</p>

<p class="tb">Those who have a short neck, high shoulders,
a round, full, and fresh coloured face, and who
are at all subject to head aches, beatings of the
temples, &amp;c. should be most careful to wear the
Cravat loose; the neglect of this precaution will
generally produce an attack of the complaint to
which they may be liable.</p>

<p class="tb">Those who are accustomed to sleep in the Cravat,
should be most careful in examining whether
it be loose. In all cases of organic diseases
of the heart, or large vessels, &amp;c. it should be entirely
prohibited.</p>

<p class="tb">Lastly.—Every person at all accustomed to
travel, and who has the least respect for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
appearance, should provide himself with a box
for containing a collection of Cravats.</p>

<p>This box must be divided into several compartments,
and be made of the following proportions;
eighteen inches in length, six inches in width,
and twelve in depth, it should contain,</p>

<p>1 A dozen (at least) of plain white Cravats.</p>

<p>2 The same quantity of spotted and striped
white Cravats.</p>

<p>3 A dozen coloured ditto.</p>

<p>4 Three dozen (at least) shirt collars.</p>

<p>5 Two whalebone stiffeners.</p>

<p>6 Two black silk Cravats.</p>

<p>7 The small iron mentioned in the first lesson.</p>

<p>8 As many copies as possible, of this important
and useful work, taking the precaution of
having them <em>well bound</em>, that they may occupy
less room.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>On the Importance of the Cravat in Society.</i></span></h2>

<p class="noindent">When a man of rank makes his <i lang="fr">entrée</i> into a
circle distinguished for taste and elegance, and
the usual compliments have passed on both
sides, he will discover that his coat will attract
only a slight degree of attention, but that the
most critical and scrutinizing examination will be
made on the <em>set</em> of his Cravat. Should this unfortunately,
not be correctly and elegantly put on—no
further notice will be taken of him; whether
his coat be of the reigning fashion or not will be
unnoticed by the assembly—all eyes will be occupied
in examining the folds of the fatal Cravat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
His reception will in future be cold, and no one
will move on his entrance;—but if his Cravat is
<i lang="fr">savamment</i> and elegantly formed—although his
coat may not be of the last <em>cut</em>—every one will
rise to receive him with the most distinguished
marks of respect, will cheerfully resign their seats
to him, and the delighted eyes of all will be fixed
on that part of his person which separates the
shoulders from the chin—let him speak downright
nonsense he will be applauded to the skies;
it will be said—“this man has critically and
deeply studied the thirty-two lessons on the Art
of Tying the Cravat.”—But again reverse the
picture—it will be found that the unfortunate individual
who is not aware of the existence of this
justly celebrated work—however well informed
he may be on other subjects—will be considered
as an ignorant pretender, and will be compelled to
suffer the impertinence of the fop, who will treat
him with disdain, merely because his Cravat is
not correctly disposed—he will moreover be
obliged to hear in silence, and to approve (under
pain of being considered unacquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
common rules of politeness) all the remarks which
he will thus subject himself to—occasionally relieved
by hearing a whisper of “He cannot even
put on a Cravat properly.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
